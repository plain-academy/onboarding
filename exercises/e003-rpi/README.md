Exercise 003
============

Setup RPi with Raspberry Pi OS Lite

- install OS on sd-card
- setup OS with Ansible, that it contains following packages:
  bc, curl, dnsutils, man, mtr-tiny, netcat, rdate, rsync, screen,
  socat, sudo, tcpdump, tmux, wget, nload
- user `pi` has password changed, to a password generated with
  your `pwgen` command

Result should be a pull request with your Ansible code, so
anyone else can reproduce your setup.
