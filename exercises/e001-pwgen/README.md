Exercise 001
============

Write simple command line in Python which generates random
string of characters:

- random characters should only be from the set of base32 characters
- command should take -u or -l option to print string as all upper or lower characters
- command should take argument which specifies how many characters to print
- by default if no argument, 32 characters should be printer
- by default if no option, upper case string should be printed

Recommendations:

- use Python 3
- use argparse module
